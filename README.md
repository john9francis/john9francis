### Hi there üëã

### About me

I am originally from Orem UT and am currently attending BYU - Idaho working on my Physics degree with a Mathematical emphasis. I have earned my Computer Programming Certificate from BYU and I thouroughly enjoy software engineering. I would say my three passions are: Physics, Programming, and Creativity.

My little family consists of myself, my wife Violet, our baby Rudy, and dog Theodore. I enjoy skateboarding, weightlifting, and generally being active. (Funny that I also love staring at a screen programming... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) 

### References to useful stuff

While developing my projects, I have stumbled upon some useful references that can be helpful for a variety of situations. Thinks like, "How to create a python virtual environment," or "How to configure a GitHub pages website." Usually I will add instructions to the README of the first repository in which I learn the specific thing. I will link here any useful references for easy access, either in the form of one of my repos or in a link to an external website.
