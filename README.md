### Useful references

While developing my projects, I have stumbled upon some useful references that can be helpful for a variety of situations. Thinks like, "How to create a python virtual environment," or "How to configure a GitHub pages website." Usually I will add instructions to the README of the first repository in which I learn the specific thing. I will link here any useful references for easy access, either in the form of one of my repos or in a link to an external website.
